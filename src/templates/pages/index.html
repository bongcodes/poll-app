    <h3>ELECTION POLLS</h3>
    <p>
      Election polls is a process of deploying surveys or polls in the election
      year to focus on issues prioritized by people, analyze engagement of people
      in the elections, understand what people think of the electoral candidates,
      and to whom people favor on voting day. Even though elections are not at
      the forefront, election polls are conducted with focused questions to identify
      public opinion about ruling and opposition parties, performance of the elected
      candidate or to predict the results of the concluded elections. In fact,
      election polls are used by many electoral candidates to understand pressing
      issues in their constituencies, flaws in the campaigns, and to analyze voterâ€™s mindset.
